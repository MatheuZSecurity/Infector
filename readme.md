# Infector

This is a simple process injection made in C for Linux systems, basically we are going to inject the shellcode from "/bin/sh" via ptrace into a process that is running and pid.c will give us the process to be able to inject.

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/MatheuZSecurity/Infector
cd Infector
make
```

The infector is based and made with reference from another repository, you can go there and take a look too. [here](https://github.com/W3ndige/linux-process-injection)
